## 🪜 Step-by-Step Summary

Here’s an overview of each section in the notebook 👇

### 🧩 1. Project Setup
- Import essential Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`).
- Configure environment settings for clear outputs.

### 📥 2. Data Ingestion
- Load dataset using `pandas`.
- Perform a quick inspection: `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape`.

### 🧹 3. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values and duplicates.  
- Convert data types (e.g., date parsing, categorical encoding).  
- Treat outliers using domain knowledge or statistical thresholds.

### 🔍 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions using histograms, boxplots, and pairplots.  
- Analyze feature correlations and relationships.  
- Identify important trends or anomalies in the dataset.  

### 🧠 5. Feature Engineering
- Create meaningful derived variables.  
- Normalize, standardize, or encode features as needed.  
- Select important features for the modeling stage.

### ⚙️ 6. Modeling
- Implement baseline models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.  
- Perform data splitting (`train_test_split`).  
- Train models and perform cross-validation for performance stability.

### 📈 7. Evaluation
- Evaluate models using suitable metrics:
  - Classification → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
  - Regression → MAE, RMSE, R²  
- Visualize performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, or residual plots.  

### 💡 8. Insights & Results
- Summarize top-performing models and key findings.  
- Highlight which variables most influence predictions.  
- Discuss trends discovered during analysis.  

### 🧩 9. Improvements & Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning for better model accuracy.  
- Test ensemble or deep learning approaches.  
- Integrate dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Streamlit) for visualization.
